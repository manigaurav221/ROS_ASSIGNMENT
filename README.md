# ros2-react-starter

A beginner-friendly starter project that connects a **React web GUI** to a
**ROS 2 Humble** node. Click a button in the browser, and a ROS 2 Python node
receives that event through a ROS topic — all running inside Docker, with
**no local ROS installation required**.

## What this starter demonstrates

- How a web app can talk to ROS 2 using **rosbridge** + **roslibjs** over WebSockets.
- How to publish a ROS 2 message (`std_msgs/String`) from JavaScript.
- How a ROS 2 Python node (`rclpy`) subscribes to a topic and reacts to messages.
- How Docker Compose can package ROS 2 + a web dev server so students run **one command**.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** (required) — installs Docker Engine + Docker Compose.
  - Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- **Git** — to clone the repository.
- **VS Code** (optional) — a nice editor for exploring the code.
- **No local ROS 2 install required.** Everything runs inside containers.

## How to run

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url> ros2-react-starter
cd ros2-react-starter

# 2. Start everything (builds the ROS image on first run)
#    macOS / Linux:
./start.sh
#    Windows:
start.bat

# 3. Open the GUI in your browser
#    http://localhost:5173

# 4. Click the "Send Message to ROS" button.
```

> The **first run takes several minutes** because Docker downloads the ROS 2
> image and installs dependencies. Later runs are much faster.

## GitHub Codespaces

Prefer to run everything in the cloud? This repo ships a ready-to-use
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) setup. **No Docker
Desktop, no WSL, and no local ROS installation required.**

1. On GitHub, click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**.
2. **Wait for setup to finish.** On first launch the container builds, ROS 2
   `ros2_ws` is compiled with colcon, and `web_gui` npm dependencies are
   installed automatically (via `.devcontainer/post-create.sh`).
3. Open the **Command Palette → Tasks: Run Task** and choose **Run ROS**.
   This builds the workspace, starts rosbridge (port 9090), and runs the
   `button_listener` node.
4. Run the **Run React** task (or just run **Run ROS + React** to do both at
   once). This starts the Vite dev server on port 5173 and, because it detects
   Codespaces, automatically points the GUI at the forwarded rosbridge URL.
5. Open the **forwarded port 5173** (the **Ports** tab, or the "Open in
   Browser" toast) to use the GUI. Click **Send Message to ROS** and watch the
   node logs in the **Run ROS** terminal.

> **Tip:** If the GUI shows "Disconnected", make sure the **Run ROS** task is
> actually running (it starts rosbridge on port 9090) and that the **Run React**
> task is running too. The GUI reaches rosbridge through a `/rosbridge` proxy on
> the same 5173 origin, so you do **not** need to change any port visibility.

The local Docker workflow above is unchanged — Codespaces support is purely
additive (`.devcontainer/`, `.vscode/tasks.json`, and `scripts/`).

## Expected output

- In the **browser**, the status badge shows **"Connected to ROS 2"** and the
  click counter increments each time you press the button.
- In the **terminal** running `docker compose up`, the ROS 2 node logs:

```
ros2_react_starter_ros  | [INFO] [button_listener_node]: Button listener started
ros2_react_starter_ros  | [INFO] [button_listener_node]: Waiting for messages on /button_press
ros2_react_starter_ros  | [INFO] [button_listener_node]: Received: "Button clicked from React GUI. Count = 1"
```

## Understanding the topic

- **`/button_press`** — the ROS 2 *topic* (a named channel). The React app
  **publishes** to it; the Python node **subscribes** to it.
- **`std_msgs/String`** — the *message type*. It carries one text field called
  `data`. Both the React side and the Python side must agree on this type, or
  they cannot communicate.

## Useful debugging commands

Open a shell inside the ROS 2 container and inspect topics live:

```bash
# Get a bash shell inside the running ROS 2 container
docker exec -it ros2_react_starter_ros bash

# Inside the container, make ROS 2 commands available
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# List all active topics (you should see /button_press)
ros2 topic list

# Print messages as they arrive on /button_press
ros2 topic echo /button_press
```

## Where to add your own code

The ROS 2 workspace is split into clear packages under `ros2_ws/src/`:

```
ros2_ws/src/
├── README.md            # full guide: file roles + recipe to add nodes
├── TOPICS.md            # central list of every topic + message type
├── gui_interface/       # SHARED: all topic names defined once (topics.py)
├── button_listener_pkg/ # PROVIDED EXAMPLE: a node that listens (GUI -> ROS)
└── student_nodes_pkg/   # YOUR PACKAGE: add your own nodes here
```

Students work mainly in **`student_nodes_pkg/`**. To add a node: create a
`.py` file, register it in that package's `setup.py` under `console_scripts`,
then rebuild. See [ros2_ws/src/README.md](ros2_ws/src/README.md) for the full
step-by-step recipe (including when a rebuild is needed) and
[ros2_ws/src/TOPICS.md](ros2_ws/src/TOPICS.md) for the topic reference.

> Because rosbridge exposes **every** ROS 2 topic to the browser, any topic you
> create is automatically reachable by the React GUI — just subscribe/publish
> to the same topic name on the JavaScript side.

## Student extension tasks

Once the basic demo works, try extending it. Each level builds on the previous one.

### Level 1 — More buttons
- Add **Start Recording**, **Stop Recording**, and **Reset** buttons to the React GUI.
- Publish a different message string for each, and watch them appear in the node logs.

### Level 2 — A fake sensor node
- Create a new ROS 2 node that **publishes** a fake temperature value to
  `/sensor/temperature` (use `std_msgs/Float32`) a few times per second.

### Level 3 — Live sensor display
- In the React app, **subscribe** to `/sensor/temperature` with roslibjs and
  display the live value on screen.

### Level 4 — Data recorder
- Create a **recorder node** that subscribes to `/sensor/temperature` and saves
  each reading (with a timestamp) to a CSV file.

## Troubleshooting

**Docker not installed**
- Install Docker Desktop from the link in Prerequisites, then restart your terminal.

**Docker daemon not running**
- You'll see: `Docker is not running. Start Docker Desktop and run this script again.`
- Open Docker Desktop, wait until it says "Running", then re-run the start script.

**React shows "Disconnected" or "Connection error"**
- The ROS 2 container may still be building (first run is slow). Wait for the
  `Button listener started` log, then refresh the browser.
- Make sure rosbridge is reachable at `ws://localhost:9090`.

**Port 9090 already in use**
- Another program (or a previous container) is using rosbridge's port.
- Stop it, or change the host port mapping in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g. `"9091:9090"`)
  and update `VITE_ROSBRIDGE_URL` to match.

**Port 5173 already in use**
- The Vite dev server port is taken. Stop the other process, or change the
  mapping in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g. `"5174:5173"`).

**First run takes a long time**
- This is normal. Docker is downloading the ROS 2 Humble image and installing
  packages. Subsequent runs reuse the cached image and start quickly.
