# Codespace / Dev Container starts, rosbridge is already listening on port 9090
# and the React GUI connects with zero manual steps. It runs the processes in
# the BACKGROUND (nohup ... &) and returns immediately so container startup is
# not blocked.
#
# It is idempotent: if rosbridge / button_listener are already running it does
# not start a second copy, so re-running (or also using the "Run ROS" task) is
# safe.
